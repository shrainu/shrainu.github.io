                Last year Apple released their first M1 Macbooks, since then resources about how to to use certain libraries and 
                frameworks is increased alot. I've been using a M1 Macbook Air for 4 months now. Of course gettings things
                work is not easy as in a Windows machine, but its not that big of a deal. Most of the stuff already supports M1 Macs, 
                and even if they don't its not so hard to get it working.
            </p>   
            <p>
                When it comes to using CMake and makefiles I'm not the best out there, in fact I'm quite bad, so I tough that there 
                might be some people like me who struggle to get modern OpenGL working on M1 architecture. Before starting just to make 
                it clear, I'm not guaranteeing anything, but if you follow the steps correctly I don't see any reason for this to 
                not work. If it doesn't work, don't hesitate to contact me. I'll be happy to help in any way that I can.

                I'm using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion IDE</a>, <strong>since Clion is using CMake this 
                article is heavily focused around CMake</strong>, but with this article, and a bit of search you should be able to get it 
                working in also XCode. For the rest of this article I'll assume that you have either <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> or 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a> installed. Before we start you need to install 
                <strong>homebrew</strong>, you can downloand it from <a target="_blank" href="https://brew.sh/">this link</a>.
            </p>

                First of all we need <strong>glfw3</strong>, and luckily there is <strong>arm64</strong> native binaries of glfw3 in homebrew. 
                We are going to install glfw3 by typing this line in our terminal.
            </p>
            <article class="code terminal">
                <p>
                    > brew install glfw
                </p>
            </article>
            <p>
                After installation completed, we are going to install GLEW. I'll be only using GLEW for this tutorial since there are no 
                big differences between GLEW, GLAD etc. If you're planning on using something else feel free to do so. We are going to install
                GLEW by typing this in our terminal.
            </p>
            <article class="code terminal">
                <p>
                    > brew install glew
                </p>
            </article>
            <p>
                Now we have everything we need we can start writing our CMakeLists.txt. If you're using CLion just create a new CLion project and 
                start editing the CMakeLists.txt file as I've shown down below, even if you're not using CLion and using CMake only process is same.

                Most of the stuff here is pretty self explanatory, only thing that we need to clarify here is the include and library folder names,
                since they might change in the future versions. If you have any problem while compiling check the folders in your own computer, and
                change the include and library paths acording to them.
            </p>

                If you followed all the steps correctly you should be good to go. I hope this article helped you to get started with Modern OpenGL on 
                M1 Mac. If you have any questions or problems feel free to contact me from <strong>batuhanyigit1705@gmail.com</strong>, I'll try to 
                answer and help you as soon as I can.
